Welcome to the 35th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

   ![Brontefy Me Devlog #3](brontefyme.png)

   [@hedgein][github] continues the [Brontefy Me][devlog-3] series! In this latest
   devlog, she gives an update on where Brontefy Me will be heading and why it
   slowed down. During a recent [stream][twitch-stream]it was also suggested
   that she's leaning towards hosting a monthly Brontefy Me Game Jam for her and
   her community, as game jams give her better accountability. Further updates
   will be given in her [discord][discord-invite]
